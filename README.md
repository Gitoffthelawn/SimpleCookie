<h2>Key features</h2>

1. <b>Domain aggregation:</b> SimpleCookie aggregates cookie data, showing only the main domains for greater clarity. For example, if you have 5 cookies for "mail.proton.me" and 4 cookies for "drive.proton.me", then SimpleCookie will show "proton.me (9)", consolidating data from all subdomains under the main domain.
1. <b>Organized list:</b> The list of websites storing cookies is neatly arranged alphabetically for easy navigation and quick access. Websites that store cookies and still have a tab open are highlighted in green.
1. <b>Effortless cookie removal:</b> A single click on a website automatically deletes all cookies associated with that domain.
1. <b>Real-time updates:</b> The number of cookies associated with each domain is shown in brackets and the pop-up is dynamically updated each time you open it and each time you clear cookies.
1. <b>Detailed view:</b> Right-clicking on a domain opens a new window with a table showing more information about the cookies associated with that site.
1. <b>Icon shortcuts:</b> The first icon on the left deletes all cookies from closed tabs and 
keeps those used by open tabs (whose domains are highlighted in green), keeping the cookies "in use" and removing those previously used by tabs that are now closed. The second icon in the middle deletes all cookies without exception. The third icon on the right deletes all cookies, browsing and download history, cache, etc.
1. <b>Theme options:</b> Light and Dark themes work seamlessly with Firefox's theme settings. The addon also uses a system font that is appropriate for the operating system it runs on.
1. <b>Lightweight design:</b> No background scripts. Font Awesome is used as the icon library.
