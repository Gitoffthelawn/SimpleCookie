**Key features**
1. <b>Domain Aggregation:</b> SimpleCookie aggregates cookie data, displaying only main domains for enhanced clarity. For example, if you have 5 cookies for "mail.proton.me" and 4 cookies for "drive.proton.me," SimpleCookie will show "proton.me (9)", consolidating data from all subdomains under the main domain.
1. <b>Organized List:</b> The list of websites storing cookies is neatly arranged alphabetically for easy navigation and quick access.
1. <b>Effortless Cookie Removal:</b> With a simple click on a website, all cookies linked to that domain are automatically deleted.
1. <b>Real-Time Updates:</b> The number of cookies associated with each domain is shown in parentheses, and the pop-up is dynamically updated each time you open it and each time you clear cookies.
1. <b>Detailed view:</b> Right-clicking on a domain opens a new window with a table showing more information about the cookies associated with that domain.
1. <b>Theme Options:</b> Light and dark themes seamlessly adjust to Firefox's theme settings.
1. <b>Lightweight Design:</b> No background scripts or unnecessary components.
1. <b>Firefox API Integration:</b> Firefox's APIs are used to display and delete cookies. The extension requires permissions for "cookies" and "<all_urls>" (needed to support the unique ordering scheme that consolidates subdomains under a single main domain).
