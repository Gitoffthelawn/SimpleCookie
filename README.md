### [ Key Features ]
#### Domain Aggregation 
SimpleCookie aggregates cookie data, displaying only main domains for enhanced clarity. For example, if you have 5 cookies for "mail.proton.me" and 4 cookies for "drive.proton.me," SimpleCookie will show "proton.me (9)", consolidating data from all subdomains under the main domain.
#### Organized List 
The list of websites storing cookies is neatly arranged alphabetically for easy navigation and quick access.
#### Real-Time Updates
The number of cookies associated with each domain is displayed in parentheses, and the popup is dynamically updated every time you open it.
#### Effortless Cookie Management
With a simple click on a website, all cookies linked to that domain are automatically deleted.
#### Theme Options
Light and dark themes seamlessly adjust to Firefox's theme settings.
#### Lightweight Design
SimpleCookie operates without any background scripts or unnecessary components, ensuring smooth and efficient performance. It's minimalist to the extreme!
#### Firefox API Integration
Firefox's APIs are used to display and delete cookies. The extension requires permissions for "cookies" and "<all_urls>" (needed to support the unique ordering scheme that consolidates subdomains under a single main domain).
